# Open Policy Network

The Open Policy Network (http://openpolicynetwork.org/) is a project of Creative Commons and like-minded organizations and individuals working to support the creation, adoption, and implementation of policies that require that publicly funded resources are openly licensed resources. The idea and subsequent development of the network is the result of a direct need identified by our community. 

Increasingly, governments around the world are sharing huge amounts of publicly funded research, data, and educational materials. The key question is, do the policies governing the procurement and distribution of publicly funded materials ensure the maximum benefits to the citizens those policies are meant to serve? When open licenses become a requirement for publicly funded resources, there is the potential to massively increase access to and reuse of a wide range of materials, from educational content like digital textbooks, to the results of scholarly research, to troves of valuable public sector data.

It is the goal of the Open Policy Network to equip advocates to work with policymakers across a variety of sector in order to realize the vision that publicly funded materials are openly licensed. The Open Policy Network launched in May 2014, and there are now over 40 organizational global members in the coalition. The Network has elected a steering committee, holds monthly planning conference calls, and shares information and policy expertise on a mailing list. The Network is currently in the process of securing funding in order to begin work on a set of priority initiatives, including a strategic planning process, development of key educational and policy resources, and further network building.
